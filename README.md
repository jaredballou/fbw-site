# fbw-site
This is the mockup for the FBW event management tool. It will have the following features:
* [ ] Set management with all performers and words in metadata.
* [ ] Have a vote screen that can be accessed publicly, which makes the users' smartphone a full-screen color with the name of performer over it. Event staff will still manually count all votes for the first release.
* [ ] Display the three words on a screen or projector.
* [ ] Record wins/losses for each round.
* [ ] Support 1v1 in a ladder to start, add other setups as needed.
